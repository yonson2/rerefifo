# rerefifo
A simple command line utility that recursively renames all files and directories in the same working directory of the script.


The pattern used to rename the files cannot be specified by the user of the script and is hardcoded inside it.


Currently replaces all names with a 4 digit number with the same number subtracted by 1.
